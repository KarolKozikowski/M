# CMD mini-game
<h4>About</h4>
<p>To pass my first programming class, I was assigned to write a C++ program that would print to the cmd console a symbol, in my case an 'M',  and move it accordingly using keyboard controls. For additional points, I added an option to readjust its preselected size, and since I had some time to spare, I also added color variations, a "help" page, a Main Menu, and a few hidden features, which subsequently scored me a 110% passing mark :)</p>
<h4>Features</h4>
- Main Menu (use arrow keys)<br>
- Prints the 'M' shape with ASCII character of choice<br>
- Screen size adaptable<br>
- Adjustable size and color<br>
- "Help" page<br>
- easter egg
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p>Doesn't work with online compilers. You need to compile the .cpp code into an .exe</p>
